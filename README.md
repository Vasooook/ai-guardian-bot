## 🔒 Project Notice

This bot was developed as part of a **custom Wix Studio project** for a specific commercial use case.  
While the architecture is tightly coupled with **Wix Studio’s backend capabilities**, many features may be adapted for other environments.  
Please note that **some functionality depends on limitations imposed by the Wix platform** (e.g., [function execution time limits](https://dev.wix.com/docs/develop-websites/articles/coding-with-velo/limits-and-optimization/compute-features)).

You are free to **explore or adapt the architecture** to your own project.  
If you’re looking to **implement a similar solution** or require help adapting this to your business — contact me.
